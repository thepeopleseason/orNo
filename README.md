# orNo

Chrome extension to remove 'Or YES' from betterworks

## Installation instructions

1. Clone this repo/download the files to a local directory.
2. Go to chrome://extensions in your browser.
3. Enable developer mode.
4. Click on "Load unpacked"
5. Choose the orNo directory.
6. Reload betterworks.

## Notes

Because betterworks loads things in API calls, this basically runs
everytime the page changes. This might be really inefficient. Who
knows? Examining another extension that does the same sort of thing
does the same, so what do I know? I'm not a FE developer (I'm a
manager, really), and I just wanted something to get rid of that
ridiculous phrasing.
