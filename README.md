# orNo

Chrome extension to remove 'Or YES' from betterworks

## Installation instructions

1. Clone this repo/download the files to a local directory.
2. Go to chrome://extensions in your browser.
3. Enable developer mode.
4. Click on "Load unpacked"
5. Choose the orNo directory.
6. Reload betterworks.

## Notes

Because betterworks loads things in API calls, this basically runs
everytime the page changes. Really inefficient; It's a little
childish and stupid, but then, so is high school.

I'm not a FE developer (I'm a manager, really), and I just wanted
something to get rid of that ridiculous phrasing.
